## 🔧 Pro Features Deep Dive

### Perceptual Hashing (PHash, DHash, WHash)

Unlike simple MD5 hash comparison, perceptual hashing analyzes the actual visual content of images. This allows detection of:
- Images that have been resized
- Photos that have been compressed
- Pictures with minor edits
- Rotated or flipped versions
- Images with slight color adjustments

### CNN Deep Learning Detection

Our Convolutional Neural Network model (powered by PyTorch) provides the most accurate similar image detection:
- Detects cropped versions of images
- Finds photos with different filters applied
- Identifies images after significant editing
- Recognizes same subject from different angles
- Works across different lighting conditions

### GPU Acceleration

When you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support:
- CNN detection: 10-100x faster than CPU
- Process entire libraries in fraction of the time
- Automatic fallback to CPU if GPU unavailable
- No configuration needed - works automatically

## 🌟 What Customers Say

*"Finally, a tool that actually understands similar images, not just exact matches!"*

*"The GPU acceleration is insane - processed 5,000 photos in under 10 minutes!"*
